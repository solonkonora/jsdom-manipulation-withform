<!-- /*Build a simple UI of a form with name and age with a button to filter a list of students.
Task
-Two input fields for the name and age of the user
-A button to submit the form, pressing enter also submits the form.
-A list of users, showing their initials, name, age, and delete button
-When the form is submitted, the page doesn't reload and the list should be filtered to show only the users that match the criteria
-The search should be robust to be case insensitive, remove spaces and compare names partially.
When the delete button is clicked, the user is removed from the list of users*/ -->
